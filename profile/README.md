<!--
Welcome to the Southern Cross AI project's repository, aimed at developing Australia's pioneering and sovereign open-source LLM through collaborative efforts across academia, research, government, and business sectors.This repository hosts the website for documenting and facilitating the collaborative development of Australia's first LLM, serving as a central hub for information, updates, and community engagement.

## Getting Involved

**Development:** Enhance the site's functionality and user experience.

**Content:** Write documentation, tutorials, and blog posts about the project's progress.

**Feedback:** Offer suggestions and feedback on the website to ensure it effectively serves the project's needs and the community's expectations.

## How to Contribute and Submit a Pull Request

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   You can also use `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, or `bun dev` based on your setup.

### Step 2: Make Your Contribution

1. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes.
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement the changes or improvements you're contributing.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
